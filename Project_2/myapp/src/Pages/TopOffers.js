            <h1>The Handmaid's Tale</h1>
            <hr />
            <p>
              In the Republic of Gilead, formerly the United States, far-right Schlafly/Falwell-type ideals
              have been carried to extremes in the monotheocratic government. The resulting society is a
              feminist's nightmare: women are strictly controlled, unable to have jobs or money and assigned
              to various classes: the chaste, childless Wives; the housekeeping Marthas; and the reproductive
              Handmaids, who turn their offspring over to the "morally fit" Wives. The tale is told by Offred
              (read: "of Fred"), a Handmaid who recalls the past and tells how the chilling society came to be.
            </p>
